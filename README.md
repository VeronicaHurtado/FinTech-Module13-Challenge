# Venture Funding with Deep Learning

## Case study

A venture capital firm is looking at using Deep Learning to help them process the funding applications they get from 
startups. The company would like a Model that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded.

The prototype Model is created in a Jupyter notebook [venture_funding_with_deep_learning](venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb)
using machine learning and neural networks techniques. Then a number of visualisations are used to evaluate the 
performance of the Model.

## Data sources

- Sample data of 34,000 organizations that have received funding over the years from the venture capital firm:
[applicants_data](Resources/applicants_data.csv)

## Tasks to support the Analysis of the data

- Preparing the data for use on a neural network model.
- Compiling and evaluating a binary classification model using a neural network.
- Optimising the neural network model.

## Technical Environment
This tool utilises the following technologies:
